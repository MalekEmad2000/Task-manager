### ***Project Proposal***

## **Purpose**
Modern day-to-day life of people in major cities is very demanding and the schedules are equally hectic. In such times, it is practically impossible to keep a track of all the activities/ appointments. Many a times, it happens that we may miss an important task; for example: taking medicines, attending a meeting, returning library books, paying the bills etc. And this cycle can keep going on endlessly. The human mind is not designed to multitask, it needs to work things out one at a time. This requires us to maintain our focus on the task at hand, and as a result other important things take a backstage and some may even slip out of our minds. In order to address this problem, we have come up with a Task Monitoring System.

## **Definition and Objectives**

This system is designed to alert the user of all the important tasks that are due. So now, the user can carry on with his/her life without any worries. The developed project is a tasks reminder app where user can add to a pool of task,sort by priority,view tasks status(in-progress/completed/upcoming).
There will be an email sent to user to alert him of the task due.

## **Plan**

Our proposed application is client/server app so, we decided to use reactjs framework as a FrontEnd and Nodejs using express as our backend.
We will use agile methedology as we focus more on the code than the documentation which is applicable in our case due to fact we work in small group consisting of three members.
